# Kat Stop Social Media Site

This is my final project for my Web Technology course. Essentially, it is a basic social 
media site that utilizes node.js and MySQL to store and display information about users. 
On it you can do the following actions:
- Create a profile
- Log in
- Browse a basic newsfeed
- Browse profile pages of users
- Make posts on your profile (Which will show up in the newsfeed)
- Edit profile informaiton

You can find the tutorial of how to interact with this website [here](Kat_Stop_Tutorial_LaFreniere.pdf).

This was a really ambitious project for me during my semester, but I had a lot of fun doing it! It has greatly 
increased my interest in learning more about full stack development and makes me want to try something new as a
personal project later.
